Ragpickers are honest workers who have little or no income,discriminated,no health insurance,little or no safety kit,harass by police,no pension,house

with consumption of pastic and other waste prod and huge dispossion into garbage and less efficient and traditional method of segrigation and decompostion and treatment of waste
ragpickers are essential parts of our waste disposing model

ragpickers usualy pick plastic,glass,metal from various sites like muncipal dumping ground,housing and industrial estates,railways,buses,Sewage system,etc
Sell them to their dealer who according to the quantity and quality of waste collected pays variable daily wages or to scrap industry or to recycling industries

Generally men go to collect the waste while the women are segregating waste.
this goes for genrations as money earned is barely sufficiant for two sqare meal for the family and have to force their children into it even if they dont want to.

they tend to develop cuts,rashes,infections due to poor protection and unsegregated waste(like medical waste is treated same as normal waste).

After swatch bharat mission gov more focus on waste managment system and ppl more aware abt keeping surroundings clean but still a long way for clean and unpolluted india.

Innovation:
Do to variable prices of waste and recent lockdown and covid conditions many times factories and middle men do not accept the collection and the family has to sleep with food and money.
Newer horizons for buisness expansion:1.Plastic roads 
2.Act as middle men and perform better sorting and segregation and into various industries 
3.Employ them with better health insurance and protections
4.Goods made with plastic and glass can be sold at gifting shops after proper training and cleaning
5.Use materials used in banners for readymade goods after sewing and decorating
